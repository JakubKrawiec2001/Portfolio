						Hi, as you already know my name is Jakub and I am 22 years old. For
						almost a year my passion has been creating websites. I consider
						myself a committed and hard-working person, and working in a team is
						not a problem for me. I decided to get into programming for a simple
						reason - it's something I love and it gives me great satisfaction.
						It's amazing to create something out of nothing. Currently I’m
						studying International Relations at the University of Wrocław. This
						is my last semester of bachelor studies, after graduation I will
						start my master's studies at the University of Applied Informatics
						where I will be able to expand my knowledge of programming, which I
						can't wait for. In my work, I follow the principle of mobile first.
						I create websites so that they are responsive and adapted to each
						user. I am currently familiar with Html, Css, Sass, JavaScript and
						React. I also worked with Bootstrap. TypeScript is next on my list.
						In the the future i would like to learn more technologies. I love to
						gain new knowledge and I treat programming as fun thanks to which I
						can experiment with new technologies. I'd love to tell you more
						about myself next time we meet.
					</p>
